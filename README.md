Mijote is a fun word game wherein you must unscramble and decode words you choose and write in a list. There are 3 levels available: Easy, Medium, and Difficult. You must choose the correct word within a certain period of time, and the faster you go, the more points you earn. The more mistakes (and the more times you don't finish on time), the less points you make (and the more points are taken away from you).
